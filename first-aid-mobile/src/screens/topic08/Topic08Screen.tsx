          Avoid driving through areas that are subject to flooding. Never
          attempt to drive over a flooded road. The depth of water isnâ€™t always
          obvious. Most flood-related deaths occur while driving.

          If the water starts to rise inside a house before you have evacuated,
          retreat to the second floor and the attic. Look for fire hazards. Fire
          is the most frequent hazard following floods. Keep the powers off
          until to safety.

          Be careful walking around. After a flood, steps and floors are often
          slippery with mud and covered with debris, including nails and broken
          glass.
